**Appearance Structure (JSONB):**

The appearance object defines the visual characteristics of a player for frontend rendering. All values are integers or booleans to ensure consistent rendering across different clients.

```json
{
  "skinTone": 3,        // Integer 1-6: Player's skin tone
                        // 1=Very Light, 2=Light, 3=Medium Light, 4=Medium, 5=Medium Dark, 6=Dark
  
  "hairStyle": 5,       // Integer 1-10: Hairstyle variant
                        // 1=Bald, 2=Short, 3=Crew Cut, 4=Spiky, 5=Medium, 
                        // 6=Long, 7=Curly, 8=Afro, 9=Ponytail, 10=Dreadlocks
  
  "hairColor": 2,       // Integer 1-8: Hair color
                        // 1=Black, 2=Dark Brown, 3=Brown, 4=Light Brown,
                        // 5=Blonde, 6=Red, 7=Gray, 8=White
  
  "facialHair": 1,      // Integer 0-5: Facial hair style
                        // 0=None, 1=Stubble, 2=Goatee, 3=Full Beard,
                        // 4=Mustache, 5=Soul Patch
  
  "accessories": {
    "headband": false,   // Boolean: Whether player wears a headband
    "wristband": true,   // Boolean: Whether player wears wristbands
    "captainBand": false // Boolean: Whether player wears captain's armband
  }
}
```

**Note**: The frontend MiniPlayer component uses these values to render the pixel art representation. Each value maps to a specific sprite or color in the rendering system.

**Attributes Structure (JSONB):**

For **Outfield Players** (`is_goalkeeper = false`):
```json
{
  "physical": {
    "pace": 15.50,        // 速度 (0-20)
    "strength": 12.30,    // 强壮 (0-20)
    "stamina": 14.80      // 体能 (0-20)
  },
  "technical": {

  }
}
```

For **Goalkeepers** (`is_goalkeeper = true`):
```json

    "pace": 8.50,         // 速度 (0-20)
    "strength": 12.30,    // 强壮 (0-20)
    "stamina": 14.80      // 体能 (0-20)
  },
  "technical": {
    "reflexes": 17.20,    // 反应 (0-20)

    "composure": 16.20,   // 决断 (0-20)
    "aggression": 9.50    // 侵略性 (0-20)
  }
}
```

**Note**:

- **API Response**: Attributes are automatically rounded to integers (0-20) for display via Transform decorator
- **Database Storage**: Attributes remain as floats for precise calculations
- OVR (Overall Rating) is calculated dynamically based on position and attributes
- Experience is stored as float and displayed with 1 decimal place
- Form is an integer (1-10) representing current player condition

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Implemented**: User, Player, Session, Team, League, Finance, Transaction, Auction, PlayerHistory, Transfer
- 🔄 **In Progress**: None
- 📋 **Planned**: Match, MatchEvent, LeagueStanding

---

## Notes

- All tables use UUID for primary keys
- All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Most tables support soft deletes via `deleted_at`
- All foreign keys should have indexes for performance
- Player attributes range from 0.00-20.00 (stored as decimals, displayed as integers)
- Currency and financial values are stored as integers (no decimals)
- Seasons are represented as integers (1, 2, 3...) for simplicity
- Auction system uses JSONB for bid history to maintain complete audit trail
- Transaction types are enum-based for consistency
