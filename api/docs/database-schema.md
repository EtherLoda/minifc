| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Unique user identifier |
| `username` | VARCHAR(50) | UNIQUE, NULLABLE | User's username |
| `email` | VARCHAR | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | User's email address |
| `password` | VARCHAR | NOT NULL | Hashed password |
| `bio` | VARCHAR | DEFAULT '' | User biography |
| `nickname` | VARCHAR(50) | NULLABLE | Display nickname (alternative to username) |

- One-to-One with `Team`

---
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL | Record last update timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NULLABLE | Soft delete timestamp |

**Note**: Age is calculated from `birthday` field. Season length is 16 weeks = 1 year (configured in settings).

**Appearance Structure (JSONB):**

The appearance object defines the visual characteristics of a player for frontend rendering. All values are integers or booleans to ensure consistent rendering across different clients.

```json
{
  "skinTone": 3,        // Integer 1-6: Player's skin tone
                        // 1=Very Light, 2=Light, 3=Medium Light, 4=Medium, 5=Medium Dark, 6=Dark
  
  "hairStyle": 5,       // Integer 1-10: Hairstyle variant
                        // 1=Bald, 2=Short, 3=Crew Cut, 4=Spiky, 5=Medium, 
                        // 6=Long, 7=Curly, 8=Afro, 9=Ponytail, 10=Dreadlocks
  
  "hairColor": 2,       // Integer 1-8: Hair color
                        // 1=Black, 2=Dark Brown, 3=Brown, 4=Light Brown,
                        // 5=Blonde, 6=Red, 7=Gray, 8=White
  
  "facialHair": 1,      // Integer 0-5: Facial hair style
                        // 0=None, 1=Stubble, 2=Goatee, 3=Full Beard,
                        // 4=Mustache, 5=Soul Patch
  
  "accessories": {
    "headband": false,   // Boolean: Whether player wears a headband
    "wristband": true,   // Boolean: Whether player wears wristbands
    "captainBand": false // Boolean: Whether player wears captain's armband
  }
}
```

**Note**: The frontend MiniPlayer component uses these values to render the pixel art representation. Each value maps to a specific sprite or color in the rendering system.

**Attributes Structure (JSONB):**

    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Stamina is now a separate field (not in attributes). Form and stamina are both float values (1.0-5.0).

**Note**: 
- All attribute values are stored as decimals (0.00-20.00) with 2 decimal precision
- **API Response**: Attributes are automatically rounded to integers (0-20) for display via Transform decorator
- **Database Storage**: Attributes remain as floats for precise calculations
- OVR (Overall Rating) is calculated dynamically based on position and attributes
- Experience is stored as float and displayed with 1 decimal place
- Form is an integer (1-10) representing current player condition

**Indexes:**
- Primary key on `id`
- Foreign key on `team_id`

**Relations:**
- Many-to-One with `Team`

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Implemented**: User, Player, Session, Team, League, Finance, Transaction, Auction, PlayerHistory, Transfer, Match, MatchEvent, MatchTactics, TacticsPreset, MatchTeamStats
- 🔄 **In Progress**: None
- 📋 **Planned**: LeagueStanding

---

## Notes

- All tables use UUID for primary keys
- All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Most tables support soft deletes via `deleted_at`
- All foreign keys should have indexes for performance
- Player attributes range from 0.00-20.00 (stored as decimals, displayed as integers)
- Currency and financial values are stored as integers (no decimals)
- Seasons are represented as integers (1, 2, 3...) for simplicity
- Auction system uses JSONB for bid history to maintain complete audit trail
- Transaction types are enum-based for consistency
- Match simulation events are stored in `MatchEvent` for replayability
- Player career stats are updated in `Player` entity JSONB column
