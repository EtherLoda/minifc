### Player Table
Represents a football player with comprehensive attributes.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | PRIMARY KEY | Unique player identifier |
| `team_id` | UUID | FOREIGN KEY, NULLABLE | Reference to Team (Many-to-One) |
| `name` | VARCHAR | NOT NULL | Player's full name |
| `birthday` | DATE | NULLABLE | Player's date of birth |
| `appearance` | JSONB | NOT NULL | Player appearance configuration (see structure below) |

| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL | Record last update timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | NULLABLE | Soft delete timestamp |

**Appearance Structure (JSONB):**

The appearance object defines the visual characteristics of a player for frontend rendering. All values are integers or booleans to ensure consistent rendering across different clients.

```json
{
  "skinTone": 3,        // Integer 1-6: Player's skin tone
                        // 1=Very Light, 2=Light, 3=Medium Light, 4=Medium, 5=Medium Dark, 6=Dark
  
  "hairStyle": 5,       // Integer 1-10: Hairstyle variant
                        // 1=Bald, 2=Short, 3=Crew Cut, 4=Spiky, 5=Medium, 
                        // 6=Long, 7=Curly, 8=Afro, 9=Ponytail, 10=Dreadlocks
  
  "hairColor": 2,       // Integer 1-8: Hair color
                        // 1=Black, 2=Dark Brown, 3=Brown, 4=Light Brown,
                        // 5=Blonde, 6=Red, 7=Gray, 8=White
  
  "facialHair": 1,      // Integer 0-5: Facial hair style
                        // 0=None, 1=Stubble, 2=Goatee, 3=Full Beard,
                        // 4=Mustache, 5=Soul Patch
  
  "accessories": {
    "headband": false,   // Boolean: Whether player wears a headband
    "wristband": true,   // Boolean: Whether player wears wristbands
    "captainBand": false // Boolean: Whether player wears captain's armband
  }
}
```

**Note**: The frontend MiniPlayer component uses these values to render the pixel art representation. Each value maps to a specific sprite or color in the rendering system.

**Attributes Structure (JSONB):**

For **Outfield Players** (`is_goalkeeper = false`):
```json
{
  "physical": {
    "pace": 15.50,        // 速度 (0-20)
    "strength": 12.30,    // 强壮 (0-20)
    "stamina": 14.80      // 体能 (0-20)
  },

  }
}
```

For **Goalkeepers** (`is_goalkeeper = true`):
```json
{
  "physical": {
    "pace": 8.50,         // 速度 (0-20)
    "strength": 12.30,    // 强壮 (0-20)
    "stamina": 14.80      // 体能 (0-20)
  },
  "technical": {
    "reflexes": 17.20,    // 反应 (0-20)
    "handling": 16.50,    // 手控 (0-20)
    "distribution": 13.40 // 出球 (0-20)
  },
  "mental": {
    "vision": 12.10,      // 视野 (0-20)

    "composure": 16.20,   // 决断 (0-20)
    "aggression": 9.50    // 侵略性 (0-20)
  }
}
```

**Note**: 
- All attribute values are stored as decimals (0.00-20.00) with 2 decimal precision
- Players see rounded integer values (0-20) in the UI
- OVR (Overall Rating) is calculated dynamically based on position and attributes
- Player appearance (skin tone, hair, accessories) is generated client-side based on player ID

## Notes

- All tables use UUID for primary keys
- All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Most tables support soft deletes via `deleted_at`
- All foreign keys should have indexes for performance
- Player stats (speed, power, skill) range from 1-99
- Currency and market values are stored as integers (no decimals)
